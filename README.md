# Product List Assignment
I have used following component from android jetpack

1. ViewModel for MVVM design pattern
2. Room
3. Data Binding
4. Dependency Injection

This app can be improved by using Paging3 but due to time constraint and unavailability of proper data api I am unable to use that.

As there is only one screen, i used Activity with layout - but using fragment would be the best option.

I have used my own boilerpalte code for startup which may contains some extra code.
